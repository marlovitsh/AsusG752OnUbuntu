# AsusG752OnUbuntu
My Scripts to make my ASUS G752VS-BA384T work with Ubuntu 16.04

## Problem 1 - solved in progress
Elan Touchpad buttons not working correctly:
left button acting like right button
right button acting like middle button
solved with a script which remaps the buttons

## Problem 2 - workaround in progress
FN - mostly not working except
  - FN-F10, toggle mute
  - FN-F11, Audio lower volume
  - FN-F12, Audio raise volume4
  - FN-HOME, Num Lock

Can't detect or activate the FN key correctly

As a workaround I use the windows button instead in combination with the function keys

use Keyboard shortcuts to assign what you want

for some I've created scripts which to the actions

## Problem 3 - not solved
Macro keys Cam/M1/M2/M3/M4/M5 and ROG key not working at all

as for now not yet found a way to detect them being pressed

xev, etc nothing at all... hmmmmm...

## Problem 4 - solved in progress
wrist detection for touchpad

can be changed in the settings in linux

have still to test to find best settings

## Problem 5 - not solved
closing the lid doesn't cause any action - should send my laptop to sleep...

## Problem 6 - not solved
Battery loading % correctly shown

Always shows battery mode, not loading, even if connected
